# GlobalNewsBot - Telegram News Bot

**GlobalNewsBot** is a Telegram bot designed to provide users with the latest news from around the world. By simply selecting a country, users can receive top headlines directly in their Telegram chat. This bot leverages the **NewsAPI** to fetch real-time news and delivers it in a clean, easy-to-read format.

## Features

- **Country-Specific News**: Users can request news from any country by entering its 2-letter ISO code (e.g., `us` for the United States, `ir` for Iran, `de` for Germany).
- **Top Headlines**: Fetches the top 5 news articles for the selected country.
- **User-Friendly Interaction**: The bot guides users through a simple conversation to select their desired country.
- **Real-Time Updates**: News is fetched in real-time using the **NewsAPI**.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid country codes and API errors gracefully.

## How It Works

1. The bot starts with the `/start` command, welcoming the user and explaining how to use the bot.
2. When the user sends the `/news` command, the bot asks for the 2-letter country code.
3. The user enters the country code (e.g., `us`, `ir`, `de`).
4. The bot fetches the top 5 news headlines for the specified country using the **NewsAPI**.
5. The bot sends the news titles along with their URLs to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used to build the bot.
- **python-telegram-bot (v20+)**: A modern and asynchronous library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API.
- **NewsAPI**: A free API for fetching real-time news from various sources worldwide.
- **Requests**: A Python library for making HTTP requests to the NewsAPI.
